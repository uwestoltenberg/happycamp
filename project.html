                    2024 is where it all begins. This phase is about transforming an idea into a vision with purpose. Itâ€™s the time to define what Happy-Camp stands forâ€”its mission, its values, and its promise to help people rediscover resilience.

                    This is the foundation for everything to come. Imagine the bungalows, the fitness areas, the community, and the moments of growth and transformation participants will experience. Itâ€™s a journey of creativity, planning, and shaping a future where Happy-Camp becomes a reality.

                    2025 is the yearâ€”where the vision of Happy-Camp begins to take physical shape. Finding the right land is about more than just a location; itâ€™s about discovering a place where transformation can happen, a space that inspires growth and resilience.

                    This phase is also about connection. Itâ€™s about reaching out to people who share the belief that resilience can change lives. Marketing efforts, including this website, are launched to share the story of Happy-Camp and invite others to join the mission. Building a strong community of like-minded individuals is key, as is finding partnersâ€”local suppliers, wellness experts, and collaboratorsâ€”who align with the goal of creating something extraordinary.
